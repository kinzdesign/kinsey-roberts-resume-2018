            <p>Yes.

For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
            <p><strong>We use cookies to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep track of advertisements.</li>
              <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings.

            <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>
            <p>See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-category="Privacy Policy" data-action="CalOPPA">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>
            <p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
              <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
              <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>You can change your personal information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>By emailing us</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
            <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
            <p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
            <p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

            <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
            <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
            <p><strong>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</strong></p>
            <p>No PII is collected from any users.</p>

            <p><strong>We do not collect your email address.</strong></p>
