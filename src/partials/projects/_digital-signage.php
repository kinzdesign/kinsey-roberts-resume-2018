          <p>Less than a year after 8 LCD info boards were installed in new residence halls, the off-the-shelf digital signage software was crashing frequently and its static layout was causing permanent image retention.</p>
          <p>As a student employee in the summer of 2006, I was asked to look at options to improve or replace the existing system.</p>
          <p>Initial conversations made it seem unlikely that we could easily adapt the existing system to meet our needs, so I began work on a new piece of software to run on the displays beginning in the fall of 2006.   I went on to deliver 4 major versions of the software and oversee dozens of new physical installations as I worked my way up from student employee to Application Developer.</p>
          <p>My software began to propagate across campus, spreading to 4 student government-owned displays and 3 additional residence halls by 2007. Housing administrators liked the product enough to invest in putting displays in all 26 residence halls during the summer of 2008. The installations expanded to additional public areas and student-serving offices in 2010 and then to two campus television stations in 2013. </p>

          <h2>Highlights</h2>
          <ul class="list-margin-bottom">
            <li>Rather than require that content be created within the digital signage software - as was common in commercial solutions - my software consumed and displayed a wide variety of data from existing systems.</li>
            <li>Content was localized to each installation and was pulled from sources as diverse as laundry machines, public printers, and shuttle busses in addition to the typical RSS and iCal feeds.</li>
            <li>Anyone with a campus login could upload flyers and photos to a website for inclusion on the displays, which became a popular method of advertising campus events.</li>
            <li>The initial 8 displays had been consumer grade Dell LCD TVs and running 24/7 with fairly static imagery took its toll. I researched more appropriate hardware and selected specialized LG and NEC LCD panels designed for 24/7 digital signage applications.</li>
            <li>Many of these purpose-built panels had the ability to activate additional image prevention modes via RS-232, which I used to have the panels dim and invert colors at night to prolong their life.</li>
            <li>When the campus TV network was upgraded to digital HD, we connected computers to the headend to broadcast the software on two channels. One channel was aimed to the general public and the other was specific to Greek Life - a budget-saving move to avoid having to installs computers alongside the displays in Greek houses.</li>
