          <p>New residence halls opened in August 2005 featuring an LCD info board in each building running off-the-shelf software, less than a year later the screens had image retention and the computers running them crashed frequently.</p>
          <p>As a student employee in the summer of 2006, I was asked to look at options to improve or replace the existing system.</p>
          <p>Initial conversations made it seem unlikely that we could easily adapt the existing system to meet our needs, so I began work on a new piece of software to run on the displays. I went on to deliver 4 major versions of the software and oversee dozens of new physical installations.</p>
          <p>Housing administrators liked the product and invested heavily in new displays, expanding from the original 8 displays to all 26 residence halls by 2008, and a total of 36 installs and 2 TV channels by 2013.</p>

            <li>Most commercial digital signage solutions at the time required content to be created specifically for the system. My software turned that upside down by consuming and displaying data from existing systems.</li>
            <li>Content was localized to each installation and was pulled from sources as diverse as public printers, laundry machines, and shuttle busses in addition to the typical RSS and iCal feeds.</li>
            <li>Community members could upload photos and flyers to a website for inclusion on the displays which was a popular method of advertising events.</li>
            <li>The initial 8 displays had been consumer grade Dell LCD TVs and running 24/7 with fairly static imagery took its toll. I researched more appropriate hardware and used specialized LG and NEC LCD panels designed for 24/7 digital signage applications.</li>
            <li>Even with the purpose-built hardware, I controlled the displays over RS-232 to activate image retention prevention modes such as inverting the colors at night to prolong the life of the panels.</li>
            <li>When the campus TV network was upgraded to digital HD, we connected computers to the headend to broadcast the software on two channels. One was aimed to the general public and the other was specific to Greek Life - a budget-saving move to avoid having to installs computers alongside the displays in Greek houses.</li>
