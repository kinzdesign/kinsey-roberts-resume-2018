          <p>Our <a href="<?php echo Project::getBySlug('server-hardening')->url(); ?>" data-category="Project - Server Migration" data-action="Body Click - Server Hardening">experiences with ColdFusion had deteriorated</a> enough that I was finally able to convince my supervisor that we needed to move on to a new language.</p>
          <p>I would be in charge of developing a transition plan and leading the efforts of one full-time staff and one part-time student employee.</p>
          <p>After researching and discussing dozens of potential languages, we settled on C# and ASP.NET in part because it is trivial to run side-by-side with ColdFusion on IIS and partially because I had previous experience with the environment and could help train the others. I began porting our templates and user controls to C# and ASP.NET, implementing object-oriented programming and separating data logic from presentation, both of which were fairly rare in our ColdFusion code. Simultaneously, I was training my colleagues on how to develop in C# for ASP.NET, supplementing the books they were reading with discussions about and dissections of the code I was writing. Soon, I had written enough core infrastructure that we could serve ASP.NET pages interchangeably with ColdFusion files with no visual difference between the two, allowing us to migrate pages <em>in situ</em> and one-at-a-time. Shortly thereafter, I wrote a simple Windows Forms application that automates most of the conversion from ColdFusion to ASP.NET for simple pages by translating page variables and user control tags between formats and providing a File Explorer like interface to show migration progress by folder and file.</p>
          <p>The migration is still underway, but we have already converted 38% of the pages on our external website and 9% of the pages on our intranet, plus two new sites have been built entirely on ASP.NET from the beginning. My full-time colleague is developing both confidence and code as time passes and our student employee has been using my conversion tool to convert simple pages.</p>
