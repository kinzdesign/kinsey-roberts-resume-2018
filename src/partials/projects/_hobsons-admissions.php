          <p>From mid-April to late-October 2017, my team was down a Business Analyst. This position helped 2 departments make efficient use of <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> platforms. One of those platforms was a suite of Admission tools from Hobsons (now Campus Management). At the time, we were using the Connect <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> and the ApplyYourself online application.</p>
          <p>My supervisor asked that I take over support of Hobsons while the position was vacant. She pitched this as an as-needed, as-possible basis and assured me that others would help fill the gap. The outgoing <abbr title="Business Analyst">BA</abbr> gave me some rough checklists, skeletal documentation and brief training.  There were choruses of "you're good at figuring things out" and crossed fingers that it would be a slow summer.</p>
          <p>Then, at one of my first admission meetings, they announced that we were launching a new degree program in August. This led to several rapid-fire thoughts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Relax! Wasn't there a checklist for this scenario?</li>
            <li>Wait, did it have any instructions? I don't seem to remember any&hellip;</li>
            <li>Maybe other people know how to do some of these things?</li>
            <li>Everyone keeps looking at me like they're expecting me to know how to do this.</li>
            <li><abbr title="obscenities redacted">#&amp;*%</abbr>! The <abbr title="Business Analyst">BA</abbr> must have handled most of this in the past.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I took a few deep breaths to convince myself that this wasn't a stress-induced nightmare. No, this was reality and I would have to peel this onion. It took weeks of research to understand the full scope of work required to launch a new degree. At times it seemed that each question I answered prompted 3 more questions for me to research. I was in frequent contact with Hobsons as well as another school at <abbr title="Case Western Reseve University">CWRU</abbr> that used their products. As the summer progressed, I would find solutions to other issues that arose and take notes. The minimalist checklists the <abbr title="Business Analyst">BA</abbr> left grew into pages of step-by-step directions. I take pride in leaving behind more documentation than I inherited.</p>
          <p>"Wow, they told us that was impossible!" became a common response when I delivered solutions, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Streamlined the flow of English proficiency test scores and scholarship amounts</li>
            <li>Created a sub-application with different essay prompts for a special program</li>
            <li>Configured a new degree program by creating the necessary configuration and reports</li>
            <li>Compiled data on a 150+ message email communication plan and presented it in a novel format</li>
            <li>Converted 26 decision letters to a responsive email template</li>
            <li>Integrated Live Chat product with Connect <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> to automate data flow</li>
          </ul>
