          <p>Demographics surveys can force people to wedge themselves into boxes that do not fit them particularly well; think of someone of mixed background and/or non-binary gender.</p>
          <p>While designing <a >my masters project</a>, I wanted to create a demographics survey that allowed for more nuanced self-identification, both to avoid participant discomfort and to get a better sense of who the participants were.</p>
          <p>Participants were able to select one or more answers from a large number of options - ethnicity (9 options), race (21 options), sex assigned at birth (3 options, could only choose one), and current gender identity (18 options) - plus an "Other" option with write-in, as well as the option to not answer.</p>
          <p>All 101 participants completed the demographics survey in its entirety, without skipping any questions. There was some heterogeneity in reported identities both within traditional racial groups and outside the gender binary. I prepared and presented a poster (below) discussing these findings at the campus LGBTQIA+ graduate and professional student group's <a href="https://sites.google.com/case.edu/intersectionality/home" data-action="Body Click - Intersectionality Forum" target="_blank" data-category="Project - Intersectional Identities">LGBTQIA+ Symposium: Doing Intersectionality</a>, where I received an honorable mention.</p>
