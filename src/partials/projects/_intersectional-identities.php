          <p>The boxes on most demographics forms are small and rigid, but some peoples&rsquo; identities are not. Think of someone of mixed ethnic background and/or non-binary gender. Forcing people to wedge themselves into boxes that don&rsquo;t fit them helps no one. Participants may feel dysphoric or invisible and the researchers are throwing out data.</p>
          <p>While designing my <a href="<?php echo Project::getBySlug('gamifying-genetics')->url(); ?>" data-category="Project - Intersectional Identities" data-action="Body Click - Gamifying Genetics">masters project</a>, I wanted to avoid these issues. I aspired to create a demographics form that allowed for nuanced self-identification.</p>
          <p>Both the structure and contents of the form would need updating. All but one question featured check boxes instead of radio buttons. This allowed reporting &ldquo;all that apply,&rdquo; instead of only &ldquo;the one that best describes.&rdquo; Each question provided an &ldquo;Other&rdquo; option with write-in blank as well as the option to not answer. For response options I went atomic, listing each identity as its own check box. This challenged the notion that identifies like &ldquo;African American&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black&rdquo; are interchangeable.</p>
          <p>All 101 of my participants completed the form. No one skipped  or declined to answer any questions. Each set of check boxes had at least two people choose more than one option. I prepared a poster for the April 2017 <a href="https://sites.google.com/case.edu/intersectionality/home" data-action="Body Click - Intersectionality Forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-category="Project - Intersectional Identities">LGBTQIA+ Symposium, <em>Doing Intersectionality</em>.</a> Charts displayed the depth of data hiding within traditional broad identities. Individual biographies of selected participants gave specific examples of complex intersections. My poster was well received and earned an honorable mention.</p>
