<p>I first began to explore Linux  as an undergraduate. I worked with a server running SUSE at the student newspaper. This server served as both a file and web server. Whenever something broke on it, I would watch in awe as someone who knew Linux connected over SSH and fixed it. I asked tons of questions and started learning the basics. Taking that knowledge - and asking for plenty of help - I built a web server for the <abbr title="Gay-Straight Alliance">GSA</abbr>. This would also become my learning project for PHP, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>Since undergrad, I have configured many personal computers to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows. Also Linux Virtual Machines have been key to many personal and freelance projects.  Throughout my graduate career, I began spending more time booted into Ubuntu. For the better part of a year, I only used Windows to run Adobe Creative Cloud programs.</p>
